I really hope you read this because Its a weekend which means we probably wont be able to schedule a meeting before the assignment due dates theres a bit I need to say.

Firstly, on the topic of this submission, I would like to justify some of my decisions. if you dont care about that and don't want to read this please read the other 2 topics becasue they are much more important.
1. the button to activate the form is purely for visuals and the gag where Bocchi seems confused about what you are doing.
2. Nowhere in the rubric does it say the palendrome checker has to remain functional during and after the form submission. I decided to disable it intentionally, this is not a bug.

Second, on the topic of 3.1, I would like to restate what I said in the comment just in case you didn't see it. 
I thought maybe you were confused about my submission so I cleaned up the repository and removed unnecassary files. Please go back and review assignment 3.1 again. If you are getting lost inside of the code.js file, you can use the regions that I set up to help navigate. The regions titled Strings Code and 3.1 code should be what you are looking for, as well as the initializeStrings function inside the Initialization functions region.
If you really arent lost or confused and you really think that my code just isn't sufficient then I would say we really need to have a meeting so you can explain to me what you want because I'm doing what my understanding of the assignment and rubrics are asking from me. I thought maybe you wanted me to use the alert boxes like I saw you doing in the live lesson so I made sure to use them in 3.2 so that you would know that I know how to use them.

finally, I REALLY need you to grade assignment 2.2.
I commented the github repo link the day that you requested it, and you didnt respond so I'm unsure as to if you thought that assignment was a 0 or if you just didn't notice.
Also I would like to make it clear that my game is NOT guess a number. Its a timing based minigame where the player has to push the button when the two numbers are equal to eachother, it might not be exactly what you were expecting but I think skill based minigame is more fun then some gambling simulator where you just read text in your browser, and random numbers are still involved.
